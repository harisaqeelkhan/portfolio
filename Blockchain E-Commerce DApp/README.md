## 📖 About The Project

Traditional e-commerce platforms act as middlemen, charging high fees and controlling user data. **BlockMarket** disrupts this model by leveraging blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer trading environment.

### Why BlockMarket?

- **Decentralized Trust**: Funds are held in a smart contract Escrow until the buyer confirms delivery.
- **Lower Fees**: No platform commissions (gas fees only).
- **Transparency**: All transactions and product history are immutable and verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Incentivized Participation**: Users earn **BlockMarket Tokens (BMT)** for buying products and leaving reviews.

## 🏗 Smart Contract Architecture

The core logic resides in two main contracts:

### 1. Marketplace Contract

The heart of the application. It handles:

- **Product Registry**: Storing product details (price, stock, owner).
- **Order Lifecycle**: Purchase -> Ship -> Confirm Delivery -> Withdraw Funds.
- **Escrow Logic**: Holding funds securely during the transaction.
- **Reputation**: Tracking seller ratings and levels.

### 2. BlockToken Contract (ERC-20)

A standard ERC-20 token used for:

- **Loyalty Rewards**: Minted and sent to users upon successful interactions.
- **Future Governance**: Potential voting rights (roadmap).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **Truffle Framework**
- **Ganache** (Personal Blockchain)
- **MetaMask** (Browser Extension)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Download the project files to your local machine using git or by downloading the ZIP file.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required node modules using your package manager.

3.  **Start Ganache**
    Open Ganache and create a "Quickstart" workspace. Note the **RPC Server URL** and the **Network ID**.

4.  **Compile & Deploy Contracts**
    Use Truffle to compile the smart contracts and deploy them to your local Ganache blockchain. Ensure your configuration matches the Ganache port.

5.  **Configure Frontend**
    The application automatically detects the deployed contract address. Ensure you have a local server running to serve the HTML files.

6.  **Import Accounts to MetaMask**
    Import the private keys from Ganache into MetaMask to simulate different users (Buyer, Seller).
